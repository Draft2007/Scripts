*1*)Creating .exe for x32 with pyexe

We need a Windows x32 with Python x32 and the following depedencies:

pyexe
pycrypto
pywin32
WMI
requests

Where setup.py is in with the rest of the client python files:

C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py build

this creates /build and /dist folders and we can find ElJefeService32.exe in /dist


*2*)Creating .exe for x64  with pyinstaller

We need a Windows x64 with Python x64 and the following depedencies:

pyinstaller
pycrypto (x64)
pywin32 (x64)
WMI (We must copy the WMI Files on PATH_PYTHONX64\Lib\site-packages)
requests (We must copy the requests Files on PATH_PYTHONX64\Lib\site-packages)

Where the client python files are:

C:\Python27\python.exe C:\PyInstaller-2.1\PyInstaller-2.1\pyinstaller.py -F ElJefeService.py -n ElJefeService64

This creates /dist/ElJefeService64.exe

*3*)Move ElJefeService32.exe and ElJefeService64.exe to /installer to generate El Jefe installer.

*4*)Creating the installer with NSIS

At this point we have two new files:

ElJefeService32.exe
ElJefeService64.exe

We need these other files :
config.ini    		           # The configuration file for ElJefe Client (used only by eljefeinstalldeployable.nsi)
default.ini    		           # Template for the configuration file for ElJefe Client (used only by eljefeinstall.nsi)
ServiceInstall32.exe 	           # Install ElJefeService on x32 
ServiceInstall64.exe 	           # Install ElJefeService on x64
msvcr100.dll                       # Dll needed for execute the service (C++ redistributable package)
cacert.pem                         # CA fake Certificate 
server.pem                         # XML Server fake Certificate 
client.pem                         # Client fake Certificate 
client.key                         # Client fake private key 
eljefeinstall.nsi                  # This is the nsis script file for the installer's creation

All this files are in /installer folder.

NSIS needs the following plugins:
Simple Service Plugin
nsprocess-modified 

Their files are in the repo (in "dependencies" folder).Stock nsprocess will not work as it cannot terminate 
SYSTEM processes.

-To install plugins-
Copy the SimpleSC.dll into the NSIS Plugins directory. 
Copy the nsprocess.dll to the plugins directory, and nsprocess.nsh to the includes directory.

Assuming you have all your binaries in place now, just run eljefeinstall nsis script (eljefeinstall.nsi).

If everything goes right you can find ElJefeInstaller.exe in /installer.




 

NOTES:

(1) Don't forget the msvcr100.dll or El Jefe will fail.
(2) The ServiceInstall files are both in C, they read from the registry to find out what .exe to install as a service. 
The only difference between the 64 bit version and the 32 bit version is the registry key, as it changes between them.
(3) Due to pyinstaller's nature, it may screw up on what would normally be valid python. It will also create two services instead of one.
(4) Finally, the uninstaller will break if any files that were not placed by the installer are added to that directory.
(5) Dependencies for build the exe files (x32 and x64) can be found in the "dependencies" folder
