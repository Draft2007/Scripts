*1*)Creating .exe for x32 with pyexe

We need a Windows x32 with pythonx32 and the following depedencies:

pyexe
pycrypto
pywin32
WMI
requests

Where setup.py is in with the rest of the client python files:

C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py py2exe 

this creates /build and /dist folders and we can find ElJefeService32.exe in /dist


*2*)Creating .exe for x64  with pyinstaller

We need a Windows x64 with pythonx64 and the following depedencies:

pyInstaller
pycrypto (x64)
pywin32 (x64)
WMI (We must copy the WMI Files on PATH_PYTHONX64\Lib\site-packages)
requests (We must copy the request Files on PATH_PYTHONX64\Lib\site-packages)


Where the client python files are:

C:\Python27\python.exe C:\PyInstaller-2.1\PyInstaller-2.1\pyinstaller.py -F ElJefeService.py -n ElJefeService64

This creates /dist/ElJefeService64.exe

*3*) 
Move ElJefeService32.exe and ElJefeService64.exe to /installer to generate El Jefe installer.
Read /installer/ELJEFE_BUILD_INSTALLER.TXT
