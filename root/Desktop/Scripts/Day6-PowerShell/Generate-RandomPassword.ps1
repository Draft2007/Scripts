# Function Name: Generate-RandomPassword
#        Author: Jason Fossen
#       Version: 1.0
# Last Modified: 25.Jun.2012
#   Argument(s): A single argument, an integer for the desired length of password.
#       Returns: Pseudo-random complex password that has at
#                least one of each of the following character types:
#                uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and
#                legal non-alphanumeric.
#          Note: # and " and <space> are excluded to make the 
#                function play nice with other scripts.  Extended
#                ASCII characters are not included either.  Zero and
#                capital O are excluded to make it play nice with humans.
#          Note: If the argument/password is less than 4 characters 
#                long, the function will return a 4-character password
#                anyway.  Otherwise, the complexity requirements won't
#                be satisfiable.

#                Use at your own risk and only on networks with prior written permission.
