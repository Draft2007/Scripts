###################################################
# This file contains a sample snort configuration. 
# You can take the following steps to create your own custom configuration:
#
#  1) Set the variables for your network
#  2) Configure dynamic loaded libraries
#  3) Configure preprocessors
#  4) Configure output plugins
#  5) Add any runtime config directives
#  6) Customize your rule set
#
###################################################
# Step #1: Set the network variables:
#
# You must change the following variables to reflect your local network. The
# variable is currently setup for an RFC 1918 address space.
#
# You can specify it explicitly as: 
#
# var HOME_NET 10.1.1.0/24
#
# or use global variable $<interfacename>_ADDRESS which will be always
# initialized to IP address and netmask of the network interface which you run
# snort at.  Under Windows, this must be specified as
# $(<interfacename>_ADDRESS), such as:
# $(\Device\Packet_{12345678-90AB-CDEF-1234567890AB}_ADDRESS)
#
# var HOME_NET $eth0_ADDRESS
#
# You can specify lists of IP addresses for HOME_NET
# by separating the IPs with commas like this:
#
# var HOME_NET [10.1.1.0/24,192.168.1.0/24]
#
# MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PLACE ANY SPACES IN YOUR LIST!
#
# or you can specify the variable to be any IP address
# like this:

var HOME_NET any

# Set up the external network addresses as well.  A good start may be "any"
var EXTERNAL_NET any

# Configure your server lists.  This allows snort to only look for attacks to
# systems that have a service up.  Why look for HTTP attacks if you are not
# running a web server?  This allows quick filtering based on IP addresses
# These configurations MUST follow the same configuration scheme as defined
# above for $HOME_NET.  

# List of DNS servers on your network 
var DNS_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# List of SMTP servers on your network
var SMTP_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# List of web servers on your network
var HTTP_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# List of sql servers on your network 
var SQL_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# List of telnet servers on your network
var TELNET_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# List of snmp servers on your network
var SNMP_SERVERS $HOME_NET

# Configure your service ports.  This allows snort to look for attacks destined
# to a specific application only on the ports that application runs on.  For
# example, if you run a web server on port 8081, set your HTTP_PORTS variable
# like this:
#
# portvar HTTP_PORTS 8081
#
# Ports you run web servers on
portvar HTTP_PORTS 80

# NOTE:  If you wish to define multiple HTTP ports, use the portvar
# syntax to represent lists of ports and port ranges.  Examples:
## portvar HTTP_PORTS [80,8080]
## portvar HTTP_PORTS [80,8000:8080]
# And only include the rule that uses $HTTP_PORTS once.
#
# The pre-2.8.0 approach of redefining the variable to a different port and
# including the rules file twice is obsolete.  See README.variables for more
# details.

# Ports you want to look for SHELLCODE on.
portvar SHELLCODE_PORTS !80

# Ports you might see oracle attacks on
portvar ORACLE_PORTS 1521

# other variables
# 
# AIM servers.  AOL has a habit of adding new AIM servers, so instead of
# modifying the signatures when they do, we add them to this list of servers.
var AIM_SERVERS [64.12.24.0/23,64.12.28.0/23,64.12.161.0/24,64.12.163.0/24,64.12.200.0/24,205.188.3.0/24,205.188.5.0/24,205.188.7.0/24,205.188.9.0/24,205.188.153.0/24,205.188.179.0/24,205.188.248.0/24]

# Path to your rules files (this can be a relative path)
# Note for Windows users:  You are advised to make this an absolute path,
# such as:  c:\snort\rules
#var RULE_PATH ../rules
#var PREPROC_RULE_PATH ../preproc_rules

# Configure the snort decoder
# ============================
#
# Snort's decoder will alert on lots of things such as header
# truncation or options of unusual length or infrequently used tcp options
#
#
# Stop generic decode events:
#
# config disable_decode_alerts
#
# Stop Alerts on experimental TCP options
#
# config disable_tcpopt_experimental_alerts
#
# Stop Alerts on obsolete TCP options
#
# config disable_tcpopt_obsolete_alerts
#
# Stop Alerts on T/TCP alerts
#
# In snort 2.0.1 and above, this only alerts when a TCP option is detected
# that shows T/TCP being actively used on the network.  If this is normal
# behavior for your network, disable the next option.
#
# config disable_tcpopt_ttcp_alerts
#
# Stop Alerts on all other TCPOption type events:
#
# config disable_tcpopt_alerts
#
# Stop Alerts on invalid ip options
#
# config disable_ipopt_alerts
#
# Alert if value in length field (IP, TCP, UDP) is greater than the
# actual length of the captured portion of the packet that the length
# is supposed to represent:
#
# config enable_decode_oversized_alerts
#
# Same as above, but drop packet if in Inline mode -
# enable_decode_oversized_alerts must be enabled for this to work:
#
# config enable_decode_oversized_drops
#

# Configure the detection engine
# ===============================
#
# Use a different pattern matcher in case you have a machine with very limited
# resources:
#
# config detection: search-method lowmem

# Configure Inline Resets
# ========================
# 
# If running an iptables firewall with snort in InlineMode() we can now
# perform resets via a physical device. We grab the indev from iptables
# and use this for the interface on which to send resets. This config
# option takes an argument for the src mac address you want to use in the
# reset packet.  This way the bridge can remain stealthy. If the src mac
# option is not set we use the mac address of the indev device. If we
# don't set this option we will default to sending resets via raw socket,
# which needs an ipaddress to be assigned to the int.
#
# config layer2resets: 00:06:76:DD:5F:E3

###################################################
# Step #2: Configure dynamic loaded libraries
#
# If snort was configured to use dynamically loaded libraries,
# those libraries can be loaded here.
#
# Each of the following configuration options can be done via
# the command line as well.
#
# Load all dynamic preprocessors from the install path
# (same as command line option --dynamic-preprocessor-lib-dir)
#
dynamicpreprocessor directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor/
#
# Load a specific dynamic preprocessor library from the install path
# (same as command line option --dynamic-preprocessor-lib)
#
# dynamicpreprocessor file /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor/libdynamicexample.so
#
# Load a dynamic engine from the install path
# (same as command line option --dynamic-engine-lib)
#
dynamicengine /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicengine/libsf_engine.so
#
# Load all dynamic rules libraries from the install path
# (same as command line option --dynamic-detection-lib-dir)
#
# dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrule/
#
# Load a specific dynamic rule library from the install path
# (same as command line option --dynamic-detection-lib)
#
# dynamicdetection file /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrule/libdynamicexamplerule.so
#

###################################################
# Step #3: Configure preprocessors
#
# General configuration for preprocessors is of 
# the form
# preprocessor <name_of_processor>: <configuration_options>

# Configure Flow tracking module
# -------------------------------
#
# The Flow tracking module is meant to start unifying the state keeping
# mechanisms of snort into a single place. Right now, only a portscan detector
# is implemented but in the long term,  many of the stateful subsystems of
# snort will be migrated over to becoming flow plugins. This must be enabled
# for flow-portscan to work correctly.
#
# See README.flow for additional information
#
#preprocessor flow: stats_interval 0 hash 2

# frag3: Target-based IP defragmentation 
# --------------------------------------
#
# Frag3 is a brand new IP defragmentation preprocessor that is capable of
# performing "target-based" processing of IP fragments.  Check out the
# README.frag3 file in the doc directory for more background and configuration
# information.
# 
# Frag3 configuration is a two step process, a global initialization phase 
# followed by the definition of a set of defragmentation engines.  
# 
# Global configuration defines the number of fragmented packets that Snort can
# track at the same time and gives you options regarding the memory cap for the
# subsystem or, optionally, allows you to preallocate all the memory for the 
# entire frag3 system.
#
# frag3_global options:
#   max_frags: Maximum number of frag trackers that may be active at once.  
#              Default value is 8192.
#   memcap: Maximum amount of memory that frag3 may access at any given time.
#           Default value is 4MB.
#   prealloc_frags: Maximum number of individual fragments that may be processed
#                   at once.  This is instead of the memcap system, uses static 
#                   allocation to increase performance.  No default value.  Each
#                   preallocated fragment eats ~1550 bytes.
#
# Target-based behavior is attached to an engine as a "policy" for handling 
# overlaps and retransmissions as enumerated in the Paxson paper.  There are
# currently five policy types available: "BSD", "BSD-right", "First", "Linux" 
# and "Last".  Engines can be bound to standard Snort CIDR blocks or
# IP lists.
#
# frag3_engine options:
#   timeout: Amount of time a fragmented packet may be active before expiring.
#            Default value is 60 seconds.
#   ttl_limit: Limit of delta allowable for TTLs of packets in the fragments. 
#              Based on the initial received fragment TTL.
#   min_ttl: Minimum acceptable TTL for a fragment, frags with TTLs below this
#            value will be discarded.  Default value is 0.
#   detect_anomalies: Activates frag3's anomaly detection mechanisms.
#   policy: Target-based policy to assign to this engine.  Default is BSD.
#   bind_to: IP address set to bind this engine to.  Default is all hosts.
#
# Frag3 configuration example:
#preprocessor frag3_global: max_frags 65536, prealloc_frags 262144
#preprocessor frag3_engine: policy linux \
#                           bind_to [10.1.1.12/32,10.1.1.13/32] \
#                           detect_anomalies
#preprocessor frag3_engine: policy first \
#                           bind_to 10.2.1.0/24 \
#                           detect_anomalies
#preprocessor frag3_engine: policy last \
#                           bind_to 10.3.1.0/24
#preprocessor frag3_engine: policy bsd

preprocessor frag3_global: max_frags 65536
preprocessor frag3_engine: policy first detect_anomalies


# stream4: stateful inspection/stream reassembly for Snort
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use in concert with the -z [all|est] command line switch to defeat stick/snot
# against TCP rules.  Also performs full TCP stream reassembly, stateful
# inspection of TCP streams, etc.  Can statefully detect various portscan
# types, fingerprinting, ECN, etc.

# stateful inspection directive
# no arguments loads the defaults (timeout 30, memcap 8388608)
# options (options are comma delimited):
#   detect_scans - stream4 will detect stealth portscans and generate alerts
#                  when it sees them when this option is set
#   detect_state_problems - detect TCP state problems, this tends to be very
#                           noisy because there are a lot of crappy ip stack
#                           implementations out there
#
#   disable_evasion_alerts - turn off the possibly noisy mitigation of
#                            overlapping sequences.
#
#   ttl_limit [number]     - differential of the initial ttl on a session versus
#                             the normal that someone may be playing games.
#                             Routing flap may cause lots of false positives.
# 
#   keepstats [machine|binary] - keep session statistics, add "machine" to 
#                         get them in a flat format for machine reading, add
#                         "binary" to get them in a unified binary output 
#                         format
#   noinspect - turn off stateful inspection only
#   timeout [number] - set the session timeout counter to [number] seconds,
#                      default is 30 seconds
#   max_sessions [number] - limit the number of sessions stream4 keeps
#                         track of
#   memcap [number] - limit stream4 memory usage to [number] bytes (does
#                     not include session tracking, which is set by the
#                     max_sessions option)
#   log_flushed_streams - if an event is detected on a stream this option will
#                         cause all packets that are stored in the stream4
#                         packet buffers to be flushed to disk.  This only 
#                         works when logging in pcap mode!
#   server_inspect_limit [bytes] - Byte limit on server side inspection.
#   enable_udp_sessions - turn on tracking of "sessions" over UDP.  Requires
#                         configure --enable-stream4udp.  UDP sessions are
#                         only created when there is a rule for the sender or
#                         responder that has a flow or flowbits keyword.
#   max_udp_sessions [number] - limit the number of simultaneous UDP sessions
#                               to track
#   udp_ignore_any - Do not inspect UDP packets unless there is a port specific
#                    rule for a given port.  This is a performance improvement
#                    and turns off inspection for udp xxx any -> xxx any rules
#   cache_clean_sessions [number] - Cleanup the session cache by number sessions
#                                   at a time.  The larger the value, the
#                                   more sessions are purged from the cache when
#                                   the session limit or memcap is reached.
#                                   Defaults to 5.
#   
#   
#
# Stream4 uses Generator ID 111 and uses the following SIDS 
# for that GID:
#  SID     Event description
# -----   -------------------
#   1       Stealth activity
#   2       Evasive RST packet
#   3       Evasive TCP packet retransmission

# ---------------------------------------------------
# This preprocessor "normalizes" telnet negotiation strings from telnet and ftp
# traffic.  It works in much the same way as the http_decode preprocessor,
# searching for traffic that breaks up the normal data stream of a protocol and
# replacing it with a normalized representation of that traffic so that the
# "content" pattern matching keyword can work without requiring modifications.
# This preprocessor requires no arguments.

# of the protocol, replacing it with a normalized representation of that
# traffic so that the "content" pattern matching keyword can work without
# requiring modifications.
#
# It also performs protocol correctness checks for the FTP command channel,
# and identifies open FTP data transfers.

# sfPortscan
# ----------
# Portscan detection module.  Detects various types of portscans and
# portsweeps.  For more information on detection philosophy, alert types,
# and detailed portscan information, please refer to the README.sfportscan.
#
# -configuration options-
#     proto { tcp udp icmp ip all }
#       The arguments to the proto option are the types of protocol scans that
#       the user wants to detect.  Arguments should be separated by spaces and
#       not commas.
#     scan_type { portscan portsweep decoy_portscan distributed_portscan all }
#       The arguments to the scan_type option are the scan types that the
#       user wants to detect.  Arguments should be separated by spaces and not
#       commas.
#     sense_level { low|medium|high }
#       There is only one argument to this option and it is the level of
#       sensitivity in which to detect portscans.  The 'low' sensitivity
#       detects scans by the common method of looking for response errors, such
#       as TCP RSTs or ICMP unreachables.  This level requires the least
#       tuning.  The 'medium' sensitivity level detects portscans and 
#       filtered portscans (portscans that receive no response).  This
#       sensitivity level usually requires tuning out scan events from NATed
#       IPs, DNS cache servers, etc.  The 'high' sensitivity level has
#       lower thresholds for portscan detection and a longer time window than
#       the 'medium' sensitivity level.  Requires more tuning and may be noisy
#       on very active networks.  However, this sensitivity levels catches the
#       most scans.
#     memcap { positive integer }
#       The maximum number of bytes to allocate for portscan detection.  The
#       higher this number the more nodes that can be tracked.
#     logfile { filename }
#       This option specifies the file to log portscan and detailed portscan
#       values to.  If there is not a leading /, then snort logs to the
#       configured log directory.  Refer to README.sfportscan for details on
#       the logged values in the logfile.
#     watch_ip { Snort IP List }
#     ignore_scanners { Snort IP List }
#     ignore_scanned { Snort IP List }
#       These options take a snort IP list as the argument.  The 'watch_ip'
#       option specifies the IP(s) to watch for portscan.  The 
#       'ignore_scanners' option specifies the IP(s) to ignore as scanners.
#       Note that these hosts are still watched as scanned hosts.  The
#       'ignore_scanners' option is used to tune alerts from very active
#       hosts such as NAT, nessus hosts, etc.  The 'ignore_scanned' option 
#       specifies the IP(s) to ignore as scanned hosts.  Note that these hosts
#       are still watched as scanner hosts.  The 'ignore_scanned' option is
#       used to tune alerts from very active hosts such as syslog servers, etc.
#     detect_ack_scans
#       This option will include sessions picked up in midstream by the stream
#       module, which is necessary to detect ACK scans.  However, this can lead to
#       false alerts, especially under heavy load with dropped packets; which is why
#       the option is off by default.

# arpspoof
#----------------------------------------
# Experimental ARP detection code from Jeff Nathan, detects ARP attacks,
# unicast ARP requests, and specific ARP mapping monitoring.  To make use of
# this preprocessor you must specify the IP and hardware address of hosts on
# the same layer 2 segment as you.  Specify one host IP MAC combo per line.
# Also takes a "-unicast" option to turn on unicast ARP request detection. 
# Arpspoof uses Generator ID 112 and uses the following SIDS for that GID:

#  SID     Event description
# -----   -------------------
#   1       Unicast ARP request

# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
#
# The SSH preprocessor detects the following exploits: Gobbles, CRC 32,
# Secure CRT, and the Protocol Mismatch exploit.
#
# Both Gobbles and CRC 32 attacks occur after the key exchange, and are
# therefore encrypted.  Both attacks involve sending a large payload
# (20kb+) to the server immediately after the authentication challenge.
# To detect the attacks, the SSH preprocessor counts the number of bytes
# transmitted to the server.  If those bytes exceed a pre-defined limit
# within a pre-define number of packets, an alert is generated.  Since
# Gobbles only effects SSHv2 and CRC 32 only effects SSHv1, the SSH
# version string exchange is used to distinguish the attacks.
#
# The Secure CRT and protocol mismatch exploits are observable before
# the key exchange.
#
# SSH has numerous options available, please read README.ssh for help
# configuring options.

# DCE/RPC
#----------------------------------------
#
# The dcerpc preprocessor detects and decodes SMB and DCE/RPC traffic.
# It is primarily interested in DCE/RPC data, and only decodes SMB
# to get at the DCE/RPC data carried by the SMB layer.
# 
# Currently, the preprocessor only handles reassembly of fragmentation
# at both the SMB and DCE/RPC layer.  Snort rules can be evaded by
# using both types of fragmentation; with the preprocessor enabled
# the rules are given a buffer with a reassembled SMB or DCE/RPC
# packet to examine.
# 
# At the SMB layer, only fragmentation using WriteAndX is currently
# reassembled.  Other methods will be handled in future versions of
# the preprocessor.
# 
# Autodetection of SMB is done by looking for "\xFFSMB" at the start of
# the SMB data, as well as checking the NetBIOS header (which is always
# present for SMB) for the type "SMB Session".
# 
# Autodetection of DCE/RPC is not as reliable.  Currently, two bytes are
# checked in the packet.  Assuming that the data is a DCE/RPC header,
# one byte is checked for DCE/RPC version (5) and another for the type
# "DCE/RPC Request".  If both match, the preprocessor proceeds with that
# assumption that it is looking at DCE/RPC data.  If subsequent checks
# are nonsensical, it ends processing.
#
# DCERPC has numerous options available, please read README.dcerpc for help
# configuring options.

# Per Step #2, set the following to load the dcerpc preprocessor

# Step #4: Configure output plugins
#
# Uncomment and configure the output plugins you decide to use.  General
# configuration for output plugins is of the form:
#
# output <name_of_plugin>: <configuration_options>
#
# alert_syslog: log alerts to syslog
# ----------------------------------
# Use one or more syslog facilities as arguments.  Win32 can also optionally
# specify a particular hostname/port.  Under Win32, the default hostname is
# '127.0.0.1', and the default port is 514.
#
# [Unix flavours should use this format...]
# output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
#
# [Win32 can use any of these formats...]
# output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
# output alert_syslog: host=hostname, LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
# output alert_syslog: host=hostname:port, LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT

# log_tcpdump: log packets in binary tcpdump format
# -------------------------------------------------
# The only argument is the output file name.
#
# output log_tcpdump: tcpdump.log

# database: log to a variety of databases
# ---------------------------------------
# See the README.database file for more information about configuring
# and using this plugin.
#
# output database: log, mysql, user=root password=test dbname=db host=localhost
# output database: alert, postgresql, user=snort dbname=snort
# output database: log, odbc, user=snort dbname=snort
# output database: log, mssql, dbname=snort user=snort password=test
# output database: log, oracle, dbname=snort user=snort password=test

# unified: Snort unified binary format alerting and logging
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# The unified output plugin provides two new formats for logging and generating
# alerts from Snort, the "unified" format.  The unified format is a straight
# binary format for logging data out of Snort that is designed to be fast and
# efficient.  Used with barnyard (the new alert/log processor), most of the
# overhead for logging and alerting to various slow storage mechanisms such as
# databases or the network can now be avoided.  
#
# Check out the spo_unified.h file for the data formats.
#
# Two arguments are supported.
#    filename - base filename to write to (current time_t is appended)
#    limit    - maximum size of spool file in MB (default: 128)
#
# output alert_unified: filename snort.alert, limit 128
# output log_unified: filename snort.log, limit 128


# prelude: log to the Prelude Hybrid IDS system
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# profile = Name of the Prelude profile to use (default is snort).
#
# Snort priority to IDMEF severity mappings:
# high < medium < low < info
#
# These are the default mapped from classification.config:
# info   = 4
# low    = 3
# medium = 2
# high   = anything below medium
#
# output alert_prelude
# output alert_prelude: profile=snort-profile-name


# You can optionally define new rule types and associate one or more output
# plugins specifically to that type.
#
# This example will create a type that will log to just tcpdump.
# ruletype suspicious
# {
#   type log
#   output log_tcpdump: suspicious.log
# }
#
# EXAMPLE RULE FOR SUSPICIOUS RULETYPE:
# suspicious tcp $HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET 6667 (msg:"Internal IRC Server";)
#
# This example will create a rule type that will log to syslog and a mysql
# database:
# ruletype redalert
# {
#   type alert
#   output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
#   output database: log, mysql, user=snort dbname=snort host=localhost
# }
#
# EXAMPLE RULE FOR REDALERT RULETYPE:
# redalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 31337 \
#   (msg:"Someone is being LEET"; flags:A+;)

#
# Include classification & priority settings
# Note for Windows users:  You are advised to make this an absolute path,
# such as:  c:\snort\etc\classification.config

# Step #6: Customize your rule set
#
# Up to date snort rules are available at http://www.snort.org
#
# The snort web site has documentation about how to write your own custom snort
# rules.

# These rules are either site policy specific or require tuning in order to not
# generate false positive alerts in most enviornments.
