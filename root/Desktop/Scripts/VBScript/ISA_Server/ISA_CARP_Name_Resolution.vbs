' Script Name: ISA_CARP_Name_Resolution.vbs
'     Version: 1.1
'      Author: Jason Fossen ( www.ISAscripts.org )
'Last Updated: 28.Jun.2006
'     Purpose: Manages how the names or IP addresses of CARP array members in an
'              Enterprise Edition array of ISA Servers are represented in the 
'              cache array script download by Web Proxy clients.  In general, best
'              to use FQDN, have multiple host records in DNS for the various IP
'              addresses of the multi-home array, and then enable DNS netmask ordering.
'        Note: You must restart the firewall service on array members in order For
'              the change to take effect.  This script does NOT restart the firewall
'              service on array members (for safety).  You must do that manually Or
'              with a different script/tool.
