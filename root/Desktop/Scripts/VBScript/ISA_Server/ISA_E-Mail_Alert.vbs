' Script Name: ISA_E-Mail_Alert.vbs
'     Version: 1.0
'      Author: Jason Fossen ( www.ISAscripts.org )
'Last Updated: 15.Sep.2005
'
'     Purpose: Sends an e-mail message using SMTP or SMTPS with the output of a
'              specified command, such as "ipconfig /all", but allows you to
'              set a username and password for authenticating to the SMTP server.
'              Also writes to the local Application event log to indicate the
'              success or failure of the message being sent.  The first argument
'              to the script, if any, is also put into the e-mail message; hence,
'              enclose a sentence in double-quotes and pass in that sentence as
'              the first argument to have it included in the message (but you
'              don't have to pass in anything at all, just edit the variables below).
'
'       Notes: ISA Server can send e-mail alerts, but you can't have a command run,
'              capture its output, then put that output into the e-mail message.
'              Moreover, you can't set a username and password, or require the use
'              of SSL for SMTPS, with the built-in message alert feature in ISA Server.
'              You can do these things by editing the variables below and then running
'              this script as the alert action.  This script does not require any
'              special software or services to be installed or running, such as Outlook
'              or the IIS-SMTP service; it uses a built-in DLL from Microsoft.
'              Don't forget to modify the firewall policy on your ISA Server to allow
'              the SMTP (TCP/25) or SMTPS (TCP/465) channel to the specified gateway.
'              If you plan to use this script to alert you to IP address changes,
'              have the "Network Configuration Changed" alert action run it in ISA.
'
'     Warning: The password you enter below is in plaintext. The command you enter
'              below will be executed on the ISA Server itself, perhaps as the
'              local System account (depending on how you configure the alert action).
'              If an adversary can edit the script, the command can be changed to
'              something unpleasant. Only allow NTFS access to the local Administrators
'              group and to the local System account, set NTFS auditing, and consider
'              digitally signing the script with your own code-signing certificate:
'              see http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/, and also

'
'     Purpose: Send an e-mail message using SMTP or SMTPS.
'
'       Notes: This script uses CDOSYS 2.0+, so it will only work on Windows 2000 and later.
'              The script does not require or use a local IIS SMTP service.
'              If the username field is blank, anonymous authentication to the SMTP
'              server is used; if the username is "ntlm", then NTLM or Kerberos is used with the
'              credentials of the WSH process; otherwise, the submitted username/password
'              will be used with cleartext basic authentication to the SMTP server.
'              Use SMTPS to encrypt session with SSL whenever possible, but remember that your
'              computer must trust the CA issuer of the SMTPS certificate at the server.
'
'   Arguments: sSmtpServer =    IP address or FQDN of out-going SMTP server.
'              bUseSSL =        True or False. Determines whether SMTP (TCP/25) or SMTPS (TCP/465) will be used.
'              sUsername =      May be blank. Username for Basic authentication; set blank for Anonymous; set ntlm for NTLM.
'              sPassword =      May be blank. Password for Basic authentication; ignored for Anonymous and NTLM.
'              sTo =            Recipient. Semicolon-delimited for multiple addresses.
'              sCC =            May be blank. CC recipient. Semicolon-delimited for multiple addresses.
'              sBCC =           May be blank. Blind CC recipient. Semicolon-delimited for multiple addresses.
'              sFrom =          Single e-mail address for the sender.  
'              sSubject =       May be blank. Subject line.
'              sBody =          May be blank. Body of message.
'              sAttach =        May be blank. Full path to local file to attach. Semicolon-delimited for multiple addresses.
