' Script Name: ISA_LogParser.vbs
'     Version: 1.2
'      Author: Jason Fossen (www.ISAscripts.org)
'Last Updated: 23.Jan.2006
'     Purpose: Demonstrates use of the wonderful Log Parser tool for querying
'              ISA Server logs, IIS logs, etc. (see www.logparser.com).  Use the 
'              script by uncommenting the query and input format you want to run,
'              then pass in any necessary command-line arguments, e.g., the name
'              of a logfile (or use wildcards to specify a set of logfiles).  If
'              you run a particular query regularly, make a copy of the script and
'              rename it after the query you've selected in it.
'       Notes: You must install the free Log Parser tool (www.logparser.com) from
'              Microsoft in order for the script to work.  You can also just 
'              register the necessary DLL (regsvr32.exe logparser.dll).
