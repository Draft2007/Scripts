' Script Name: ISA_Parse_Raw_Hex_Payload.vbs
'     Version: 1.0
'      Author: Jason Fossen (www.ISAscripts.org)
'Last Updated: 19.Aug.2005
'     Purpose: Extracts the raw hex protocol fields out of the lines from an ISA
'              Server firewall log and decodes it using tethereal.exe, which is 
'              a part of the free Ethereal sniffer at http://www.etheral.com.
'              Log lines must be passed in as standard-input (StdIn) to the script
'              and you must pipe through cscript.exe.  For example:
'                  find.exe "10.4.4.4" ISALOG_FWS.w3c | cscript.exe ISA_Parse_Raw_Hex_Payload.vbs
'              Notice that you must specify cscript.exe.  Works with both types of
'              text logs produced by the firewall service (.W3C and .IIS), but Not
'              MSDE database logs.  Script is too slow to process entire log files,
'              so use find.exe/findstr.exe/grep.exe to only parse what you want.
'        Note: If you didn't install Ethereal into %ProgramFiles%\Ethereal\, Then
'              edit the sEtherealPath variable below.

' Note: Why not just pipe the output of text2pcap.exe into tethereal.exe?  Because it doesn't work
'       reliably enough on Windows.  Why not write all the lines to a single file and then run
'       text2pcap.exe on that one file?  Because ISA is logging the headers of packets that are very
'       often malformed or deliberately mangled.  When Ethereal or tethereal.exe read in a libpcap
'       file with corrupted packets, they just stop.  We want to parse as many of these headers
'       as possible and show error information, hence, it must be done one packet at a time.  Very
'       inefficient and ugly, I know, but that's the way it goes...
